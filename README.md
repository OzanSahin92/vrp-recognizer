# vrpRecognizer

Recognizes vehicle registration plates (vrp) and finds out to which country and city 
the vehicle belongs.

## to-dos
- refactor vrpAssigner.views so that VrpLocationSerializer is used more efficiently
- add data of all European vehicle registration plates into database
- add tests
- find a way to deploy django web server so that other devices can access it
- finally add a way to recognize vehicle registration plates from  pictures as a independent app/rest api
- add CI with Dockerfile
